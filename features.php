                    The mobs on this server have quite a bite to them! They will level up along with your current weapons, armour and xp level. Custom unique bosses will also randomly spawn around the map and harbour amazing loot when killed, although some of the harder bosses will be in set locations and will be dungeon/raid-like. Team up with some buddies to take them down!
